						<p>MARCUS--David. The officers, board and staff of the American
							Technion Society (ATS) mourn the loss of David Marcus of Chicago,
							a decades long supporter with vision and dedication to the ATS,
							the Technion and Israel. Mr. Marcus was a stalwart of our Chicago
							Chapter, where he served on the Board during the 1980s and 1990s,
							including as chapter president. He also served on the national
							Board of Directors and was an active leader of the Investment
							Committee. Mr. and Mrs. Marcus supported numerous vital Technion
							projects including the Norman and Helen Asher Space Research
							Institute, the Chicago Chapter Organic Chemistry Laboratory and
							the Chicago Chapter Computer Centers Project. Mr. Marcus'
							devotion was recognized in 2002 with an Albert Einstein Award,
							the highest honor the ATS bestows. We extend our sincere sympathy
							to David's wife, Susan, his daughter Miriam Nirenberg, sons Bruce
							and Steve Marcus, and the entire Marcus family. American Society
							for Technion-Israel Institute of Technology Joan Seidel,
							President Stephen A. Laser, Chairman of the Board Melvyn H.
							Bloom, Executive Vice President David Rappaport, Chicago Chapter
							President Richard Zelin, West Central Region Director</p>
